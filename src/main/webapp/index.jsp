		A CI/CD pipeline is an automated process that streamlines the journey of software development from writing code to deploying it in production. 
        It integrates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) practices to ensure faster, more reliable, and secure software delivery.

	<p>
		DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to automate and integrate the processes and tools for building, testing, and delivering software more quickly and reliably. It is a cultural mindset focused on collaboration and shared responsibility between formerly siloed teams, breaking down barriers between developers, operations, quality, and security to deliver continuous value to customers.
